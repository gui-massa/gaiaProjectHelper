Back-End board helper for playing the Boardgame Gaia Project

The logic and possibilities inside the game is huge, therefore I decided to create this application to help players calculate their turns.
The game has 14 player boards, and for now it is just considered 1 player board, since. Still to add all player boards when I decide to make it an web application. All main possible logic on boards are implemented already, just need some workforce to actually implement the other 13 boards and make it an actual web-app.
